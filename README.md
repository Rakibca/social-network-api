## Description
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. We are using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js & Mongoose packages, we used a JavaScript date library called Moment to format the timestamps.
